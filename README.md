Developed and tested a Finite State Machine (FSM) Sequence Controller using SystemVerilog. Designed an 8-state Mealy machine for controlling CPU operations based on opcode and state inputs. Created a comprehensive testbench to validate the FSM's functionality, ensuring accurate state transitions and output generation.
